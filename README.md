# Tax Flywheel

Tax Flywheel is an economic experiment built around a simple inversion:

**What if taxes didn’t disappear —  
but instead fed a self-reinforcing loop?**

Instead of treating taxes as dead weight,  
the Tax Flywheel converts them into motion.

Every tax feeds the wheel.  
Every spin rewards holders.

## Core Thesis

Traditional taxes extract value and stop there.

The Tax Flywheel does the opposite:
- it **collects**
- it **recycles**
- it **feeds itself**

Pain is not avoided.  
Pain is **reused**.

If you feel it, the wheel is turning.

## The Tax Flywheel Mechanism

At the center of the system is a simple loop.

### High-level flow

1. **Transactions incur a tax**
2. **Collected taxes feed the flywheel**
3. **Tax flow funds automated buybacks**
4. **A portion of bought supply is burned**
5. **Supply tightens**
6. **Remaining value reinforces holders**
7. **Reinforced holders sustain activity**
8. **Activity generates more taxable flow**

The loop closes.

Taxes become pressure.  
Pressure becomes momentum.

## Why a Flywheel?

Taxes alone are punitive.

A flywheel changes the dynamic:
- the cost is visible
- the feedback is mechanical
- the response is proportional

More activity → more tax  
More tax → stronger response  
Stronger response → higher participation

Nothing is hidden.  
Nothing is wasted.

---

## Design Principles

- Taxes are explicit, not abstract  
- Redistribution is mechanical, not discretionary  
- Buybacks are programmatic, not narrative-driven  
- Burn introduces long-term supply pressure  

No promises.  
No exceptions.  
Only flow.

---

## Tax as a Signal

In the Tax Flywheel, tax volume is not a side effect.

It is the **signal**.

High tax flow indicates:
- high activity
- high participation
- high system engagement

The system responds automatically,  
without interpretation or intervention.

---

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — mechanism specs, tax logic, parameter notes
- `scripts/` — simulations (tax → buyback → burn)
- `programs/` — future on-chain tax routers and automation
- `apps/` — dashboards and transparency tools
- `packages/` — reusable primitives

---

## Status

This repository documents the **design and modeling phase** of the Tax Flywheel.

Parameters (tax rate, buyback ratio, burn ratio) are subject to iteration
and will be formalized through simulation and testing.

The mechanism is intentionally simple.
The consequences are not.

---

## Closing

Taxes usually disappear into nothing.

Here, they don’t.

They turn the wheel.

You feel the pain?  
Good. It means the system is working.
